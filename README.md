# FizzBuzz

Count from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 and 5 with certain words.

## Motivation

This was created in response to a challenge problem in an online Thinkful course.

## Features

The expected user workflow is:

* A person visits the page and presses the "FizzBuzz" button.

* The numbers 1 to 100 are logged to the console. All multiples of 3 are replaced with the word "Fizz", while all multiples of 5 are replaced with the word "Buzz". If a number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it is replaced with "FizzBuzz".
